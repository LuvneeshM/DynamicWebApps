Dynamic Web Dev
Web App: Albert

Design Weaknesses: 
	- In order to add a class/look at classes, there is a pop up that does not scroll with the page
	- There is a blank page as the tab icon
	- When showing courses in the inital shopping cart, they only show the class code and not the actual class name
Operation Weakness: 
	- Inability to access classes and schedule at the same time
	- A forced 20 minute renewal else you are logged out if there is inactivity

Why I like it:
	While there are many flaws both from an operation and design standpoint, it is still a strong website for being able to accomplish it's ultimate purpose.

Improvements:
	The user experience of the web application is not entirely straightfoward and defintely has a learning curve to it. I would primarily focus on improving the overall design and layout to make it more intutive while keeping in mind the flaws and wants of the students.
